# World Projects

Hyperfy world projects are normal Node projects that contain only game code and assets. They are synced to a running world via the app-server and can be deployed explicitly for staging/production.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Scaffold a new project
npx gamedev init

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local world + continuous sync
npm run dev
```

The scaffolded `package.json` includes `gamedev` and `typescript` as devDependencies.
Built-in apps and a default `$scene` entry are included in `apps/` and `world.json`.

World projects are meant to live in their own repository (no engine source). The CLI syncs your files to a world server:
- If `WORLD_URL` points at localhost/127.0.0.1, `gamedev dev` starts a local world server and the app-server.
- If `WORLD_URL` is remote, `gamedev dev` skips the world server and only runs app-server sync.
- Use `.env` or `.lobby/targets.json` to point at different worlds.

## Project Layout

```
apps/                       App scripts + blueprint JSON (defaults)
assets/                     Local assets referenced by blueprints
shared/                     Shared script modules (import via @shared/ or shared/)
world.json                  World layout + per-instance placement/props overrides
tsconfig.json               TypeScript config (points at `gamedev` types)
.nvmrc                      Node version for this project
.env                         Local world/app-server config (gitignored)
.env.example                Shareable template for env vars
.lobby/targets.json         Local-only deploy targets (gitignored)
.lobby/targets.example.json  Shareable template for targets
.claude/skills/             Claude Code skill docs for app scripting
```

## What to Edit

- `apps/<AppName>/index.js` for entry scripts.
- `apps/<AppName>/**/*.js` for module helpers.
- `shared/**/*.js` for shared modules used by multiple apps.
- `apps/<AppName>/*.json` for blueprint defaults (props, model, flags, `scriptFormat`).
- `world.json` for layout and per-instance placement/props overrides.
- `assets/` for local files referenced by props/blueprints.

## What Not to Edit

- `.lobby/<worldId>/` is local runtime state.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` is per-developer.

## Claude Code

The scaffold includes `.claude/skills/hyperfy-app-scripting/SKILL.md` to guide app scripting tasks. Commit the skill folder, and keep local Claude settings in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored).

## Targets and Deploys

- Use `.lobby/targets.json` for local targets (dev/staging/prod).
- Commit `.lobby/targets.example.json` as the shareable template.
- Use `gamedev dev` for continuous sync (dev only).
- Use `gamedev app-server` for sync only (no local world server).
- Use `gamedev apps deploy <app>` for explicit staging/prod deploys.

## Existing Worlds

If you need to pull an existing world into a local project (including scripts):

```bash
gamedev world export
#
# Add this for legacy single-file scripts:
gamedev world export --include-built-scripts
```

## Migration Notes

- Bundling is removed. Use `scriptFormat` to control how the entry is interpreted.
- Tag existing apps with `gamedev scripts migrate --legacy-body` (keep classic body scripts) or `gamedev scripts migrate --module` (convert to ESM default export).

## Scripting Reference

Use the scripting docs for runtime APIs and lifecycle:

- `docs/scripting/README.md`
- `docs/scripting/app/App.md`
- `docs/scripting/world/World.md`
